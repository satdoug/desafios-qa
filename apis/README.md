# Idwall - API Test Automation Challenge

## Execute tests through dockerized Jenkins
* Pre-requisites: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed on host/local machine 
* Execute the following command in a Terminal 
```text
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 sfrubio/sfrubio:desafio-qa-jenkins
```
* Ensure that the Docker container is pulled and running in your host. In terminal, run the following command:
```text
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                              NAMES
339dc64edf95        08b0e7913330        "/sbin/tini -- /usr/â€¦"   5 hours ago         Up 5 hours          0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:50000->50000/tcp   desafio-qa-jenkins
```
* Log in Jenkins, access job [idwall-api-test](http://localhost:8080/job/idwall_api_test) and click on "Build with parameters"

* Fulfill the presented fields according to what data is required for test execution.
* In addition, it is allowed to choose the test group to be executed, on dropdown field "testGroup"
* To start test execution, click on button "Build"

* After test execution, results will be placed in [Allure Reports](http://localhost:8080/job/idwall_api_test/allure/):

## Run test cases with Maven
### Execute test cases with default parameters
```text
$ mvn clean test
```
### Execute test cases with test parameters
```text
$ mvn clean test -DvalidName="Valid Name" -DvalidNumber="Valid Document Number" -DvalidBirthday=<Valid Date>
```
Available fields and default values:
* `-DvalidName=Test`
* `-DvalidNumber=00000000191`
* `-DvalidBirthday=1982-11-12`
### Execute test cases for a specific functionality
```text
$ mvn clean test -DtestGroup="functionality"
```
### Run tests for a specific functionality
```text
mvn clean test -DtestGroup="products"
```
Functionalities available: _to be defined_
### Run tests cases with blocker severity
```text
mvn clean test -DtestGroup="blocker"
```
### Generate Allure reports
```text
$ mvn allure:aggregate
```
The Allure report should be generated in folder `target/allure-results`, as defined on Surefire configurations

## Summary of the provided solution.
* Docker image based on the [Official Jenkins Docker image](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/README.md), just modified Dockerfile to build a image with `/var/jenkins_home` not stored in a volume 
* Tests designed in Java language, using JUnit5 test framework and Apache Maven for build.
* Additional tools:
  * [Allure](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/) (for test report)
  * [Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/) (for assertions)
  * [RestAssured](http://rest-assured.io/) (for HTTP requests)
  * [Random Beans](https://github.com/benas/random-beans) (for randomized values)
  * [Awaitility](https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility) (for implementation of polling logic on asynchronous requests)
* Test classes and methods were tagged, in order to allow the test execution through command line, by defining which `testGroup` will be executed. 
* Test classes were separated per functionality, and structured in 4 classes:
  * `<Functionality>Test.class`: Containing the test scenarios;
  * `<Functionality>TestData.class`: Containing the steps needed to create test data;
  * `<Functionality>TestSteps.class`: Containing the steps to execute requests, assert status codes and get response payloads;
  * `<Functionality>TestAssertions.class`: Containing the steps to made assertions according to test scenario.
* Created specific DTO classes in `/src/main/dtos/`, to help on request/response payload serialization/deserialization, as well as to keep assertions more descriptive.
